# Spy Test Suite Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Spy game test suite!

## Overview

The Spy Test Suite is a monorepo containing specialized packages for testing, benchmarking, and visualizing the fairness and performance of spy selection algorithms in the Spy game.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install all dependencies
make install

# Run all tests
make test

# Generate documentation
make docs
```
